Now it's easier with electronic voting.  Whoever programs the software decides the election.  Extra ballots can be printed and filled out to skew the numbers, or ballots can be thrown away.  No amount of auditing will help keep elections safe.  Now, you have media and big tech influencing people.  It's not fair or decent.  If the people in charge wanted elections to be fair they would issue one ballot per one eligible state issued ID, and signed for by that person.  Once it's issued, the ID is no longer eligible to receive a ballot.  This should then be triple counted, by randomly selected bipartisan groups.  Also the two party system in the US needs to go.  The US is big enough to support 5 or 6 parties, especially now with the rise of communism/socialism in the states.
